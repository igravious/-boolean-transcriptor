Boole Papers
------------

In 1984 the Boole Library at University College Cork acquired at auction at Sotheby’s  of London a collection of original letters and papers mostly written by George Boole FRS (1815—1864).  The material was in a sense coming home as Boole had been the first Professor of Mathematics (1849—1864) at the then Queen’s College Cork, now University College Cork. The whereabouts of this material for a hundred and twenty years is not definitively known, but it is believed that much of it was collected by Boole’s sister Mary Ann (1818—1887) and after her death was kept by Boole’s descendants, possibly by the family of Boole’s eldest daughter, Mary Ellen Hinton.

Digital Era
-----------

Boole of course is often called the father of the digital age, so it is  very fitting that Anthony Durity has now built a digital platform for the collaborative (crowd-sourced) transcription of the letters and papers in the above-mentioned Boole Collection. In the spirit of open access, this will ensure that the material will be available to scholars worldwide on the internet. Surely Boole would have been immensely pleased at a development such as this which depends  so vitally on the applications of his work in Logic, discovered long after his death.

Software Transcription Desk
---------------------------
        
Anthony Durity  has done a painstaking and thorough job in applying the finding aid of the collection and making it machine readable, thus allowing access to digitalized scanned copies of items in the collection. One now has  the facility to create notes on the material leading to the ability to create digital scholarly editions, and to aid the process of collaboration and transcription. It is also possible to highlight significant selected portions of the images, leading to semantic annotation. So index terms associated with every scan can be handled electronically and integrated into electronic formats.

Boolean scholars worldwide owe a great debt of gratitude to Anthony Durity for his work in raising studies on this great thinker to an exciting new level online.
