            From Boole in Lincoln to Maryann who is holidaying with the Parry's. He advises her on where to sight-see and hopes the trip will improve her health and urges her to spend as much time in the fresh air as she can. Mentions a local schoolteacher who is renting his schoolhouse in the evenings to a temperance society. Boole feels this is a good idea, but he expects objections from the landlord. He tells her not to worry about him and their mother as Mrs. Elston is housekeeping for them, although he adds she cannot be said to replace Maryann. He includes some light-hearted verse beginning 'Maryann and Mary Jane I have heard your friends complain, that your cheeks are not so red, that their [roses] health are fled.'

He also gives instructions for a number of donations to be made to charities in Lincoln [arising out of the settling of his late father's affairs], and instructions for Mr. May, the stonemason, as to the format of his father's tombstone.

            From Boole in Lincoln to Maryann in which he deliberates over his future career. He applied for a professorship in Ireland but in the meantime was offered the headmastership of a Grammar School in Lincoln. He has received strong hints that he has been selected for the professorship but he is unsure which position to choose. The headmastership would be more financially profitable but he feels 'the Irish professorship will on the whole if I get it be the best for me'. He binds her to secrecy about his deliberations.

            From Boole on holiday on the Isle of Wight to Maryann excitedly telling her how he is enjoying his holiday and describing the pleasure he feels when walking in the beautiful scenery. He has heard from Mr. Collins that her health is better and hopes she is happy and well looked after at Alticton and comments favourably on the scenery in that area. He adds though that he would enjoy some company on his holiday, he finds it a drawback to be there by himself. 'Monday the 16th is our examination E.B.' has been added at the end of the letter.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann informing of his safe arrival there and his impressions of Cork and Ireland. He seems pleased with his new home 'The situation and the prospects around are all that could be desired'. Of the city he says it is 'rather fine', but 'like every other large hive of men it has of course its wretched [ ] abodes of misery'. However, the effects of the Famine were visible; of the countryside he saw on his train journey from Dublin to Cork 'it is impossible to speak in terms too sad'. He saw 'scarcely a human being by the way or a herd of cattle in the fields'. He describes an encounter at Limerick Junction with some male peasants who had a unique air of 'defiant idleness' about them and comments that a man he met there told him he was paying 9s.6d in every pound to the poor rates.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann, telling her about social conditions in Cork. Of the area around the college he comments that he sees little of the misery and poverty so abundant in the city. He describes an encounter with a crowd of beggars in a street who 'far exceeded in horror anything not only that I had ever before witnessed but that I had even read of'. He feels private efforts are not enough to alleviate the situation. He then describes a recent trip he took with Raymond De Vericour professor of Modern Languages at [Q.C.C.] to Queenstown [Cobh], which reminded him of Lake Geneva and the Scotch lakes. He sends good wishes home to his friends and neighbours.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann sending her advice on the financial running of her school (when to send bills). He also mentions the Q.C.C. inauguration ceremonies are scheduled for the following week, while the scholarship exams are due to finish that day. His ceremonial robes are faced with scarlet which he finds somewhat offensive 'To so sound a Protestant as I am this is a rather uncongenial colour'. He closes by requesting her to tell all his Lincoln friends he will write soon.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann discussing financial matters relating to her school and giving more of his impressions of Cork. His teaching duties have been set at two hours a day for two classes 12.30 to 2.45 with a 1,4 of an hour break, and he hopes his fees will cover his personal expenses and leave his salary clear, but this will depend on the number of students who are accepted. He expects 200 to have entered by the end of the college's second year. He has been well received in Cork and believes his family could live there contentedly. Food is quite cheap, salmon being 4d. a pound; and fowl also very reasonable. His landlady is very conscientious but he remarks that his mother would be surprised at the juxtaposition of food she serves, turkey with beef, roast goose with roast bacon and cheese with butter.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann giving her general news. He approves of Mr. Collins scheme [for her school] and compliments her on her version of Filcara which he felt was a fine composition but makes a few suggestions for alternative wording. He mentions he wrote three sonnets lately. With regard to Q.C.C. he received £28.10s.0d. from the bursar for fees, the next instalment of which will be due in January. He is lecturing from 1 - 3 every day except Saturday and declares 'I like my classes and only regret that they are small'. He is sorry to hear his mother is unwell but wants her to know he followed her advice to use a hot water bottle and no longer has damp sheets.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann mainly discussing her school and her dispute with Mr. Swift, stating he is more than surprised at Swift's behaviour. He comments on her circular advertising her school, and suggests a lady should not praise herself, but rather let her work be her advertisement. He advises her not to have her fees too high for fear of excluding respectable tradesmen 'and they will be your best suppliers not the aristocracy'. Raymond De Vericour has been ill but is recovering and Boole comments 'he is an unbounded favourite in Cork especially with the ladies whom he has won over by his lectures, his graceful manner and fine person'.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann containing more advice about her advertisement circular for her school. He believes a ladies' school should be run by ladies and feels Maryann is competent to teach arithmetic and geography and, so, need not state Mr. Collins will be on hand to assist her in those subjects as that would be an admission of ignorance. He believes she will distinguish herself as a woman teaching those subjects. He encloses a cheque for 10 guineas.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann mainly replying to statements in a letter from Maryann. He is sorry to hear their mother is unwell and states she is not to be worried about the future 'she has no real cause of anxiety there'. He advises her on when to break up her school at Christmas, that if Mr. Swift wishes to break up at the 14th then acquiesce as it would give him an earlier opportunity of meeting the children's parents. He also instructs her to re-order the Education Times for six months for him. College is still going well, although his classes are still small. The wet weather has forced him to buy another pair of strong shoes, rain coat and a dressing gown. The damp climate has caused his walking stick to twist like a corkscrew, but a hot water bottle keeps his bed dry.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann, a letter full of general news. He offers his sympathy on the illness of Mr. Merryweather, compliments her on her circular and states the money she makes from her school will be hers to do as she likes with and adds he will always be willing to support her financially. He sends his regards to all his Lincoln friends and inquires after his mother's health. The college has now taken in about 40 students, but he is not sure of the exact number. He went for a seven mile walk the day before and had planned to walk that day but the incessant rain has flooded all the roads and fields. However, he remarks the floods can abate in less that a day. Adds he visited the Cork Union [now St. Finbarrs Hospital] which contained 4,700 inmates. Mentions he is not looking forward to the long voyage home.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann explaining his travel plans for his trip home. He hopes to arrive with a friend at 3 p.m., but will be later if he has to go via Holyhead rather than Liverpool. He is glad she sorted out her school problems but would like to have seen the pupils before they left. He is bringing his professional robes for their mother to see, but implores her to tell no one as 'I don't want to be teased by people'. He remarks he doesn't like their scarlet colour. He went to hear 'the Creation' last night which was very well performed. Sends good wishes to all his Lincoln friends.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann. He hopes she received his cheque, and advises her when sending bills to pupils to make sure she does not overcharge. He himself is getting on well, 'I get on in the most satisfactory manner with my classes' apart from having a bad cold. Twenty more students from Newfoundland are expected in January. His landlord, Mr. O'Brien, lent him a pianoforte which he says is an example of the kindness he receives everywhere 'I really do not think that there is anything like it to be found in England except in case instances'. He mentions the anniversary of their father's death and comments on how much better off they are than many. He adds that the Roman Catholic, churches in Cork have a low standard of music although he had heard some charming music in Cork. Mentions he plans to 'beg or buy' a drawing of a child by Miss F.C. recommended by William Brooke.

He mentions his new colleague, Mr. Shaw, whom he likes and concludes 'My situation is on the whole pleasanter than it was last term'.

He relates what he has been doing and mentions the people he has met including a Quaker gentleman who owns a telescope. He is becoming increasingly dissatisfied with his lodgings 'I do not feel that I am working so steadily as I ought to do. I am beginning to doubt whether living in lodgings is so favourable to the progress of one's studies as I had hoped to find it'. He does add that he does some work each day. He hopes her school is prospering.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann consoling her about the small number of pupils attending her school. He adds even if the school does not succeed she at least tried. He wonders if she could visit Cork. His social life is busier than ever and having his family around him would make things perfect. He adds also that he is working quite hard. He instructs her to have the outside of the house Mr. Dickson is renting painted and discusses Lincoln news she sent to him. He also instructs her to withdraw £25 from the bank to support herself.

He instructs her to tell Mr. Collins and Mr. Swift that it is the tenant who owes the property tax, and that Mr. Swift owes rent.

He asks Maryann to inquire if Lilley is unemployed and if so to ask Mr. Dickson if he could give Lilley instruction for three hours per week. He hopes that might improve Lilley's character. He again complains that she is very slow to answer his letters. He has heard from his brothers Charles and William and remarks that Charles' letter was all about his wife Eliza, but was 'quite a pattern letter for an affectionate husband'. However, he adds he is very glad to hear they are happy.

            Incomplete letter from Boole in Cork to Maryann discussing her dispute with Mr. Swift and his own lifestyle in Cork. He feels Mr. Swift's letter to Maryann' was 'the production of a very coarse mind and you have answered it exactly as you ought'. He feels they will have a lot more trouble from Swift. Mentions he has resigned himself to the fact that it will rain throughout the Autumn terms and be dry occasionally during the other terms. He has been invited out to tea three times in succession and feel this is a good omen. He prefers joining a family at tea rather than at dinner. Due to his social obligations he has resolved to get up earlier in the morning to get more work done. The Queen's Colleges have begun to acquire a good reputation for teaching in Ireland and the Methodists have decided to give it their support although the Catholics remain divided. Mentions some domestic arrangements concerning the employment of [Charles ] and also that he would like to aid the Atkinson family of Lincoln financially. He inquires if he left some underclothes in Lincoln as he is missing some. Also he feels no addition is necessary to their father's tombstone.

            From Boole in Cork to Maryann explaining why he has moved to new lodgings in Strawberry Hill. At his old lodgings at Castle White he spent too much time in conversation and not enough in work. This new accommodation is very pleasant and run by three middle aged sisters 'apparently very intelligent and respectable'. He has decided to dine out only once a week and then only as a reward for hard work. His lecturing at college has been complimented but he stresses he is only telling her that to give her and their mother pleasure, not to boast. He has been told many times that his lectures are amongst the most popular with the students. He closes by commenting on news from Lincoln that Maryann wrote about and again instructs her to offer financial help to the Atkinsons.

He complains that she has not written to him in over a fortnight and hopes she is not ill either. His friends, the Jennings, sent him jam and vinegar which he was instructed to rub into his skin. As a result his swollen face improved now resembling 'a good natured farmer - looking fierce in which all mankind would be disposed to place the most implicit confidence'.

He advises her against buying recommendations, he would rather that she should prove her worth by work. In Cork a strong South Easterly wind has caused tidal flooding to occur in the city resulting in distress and hardship especially for the unfortunate poor who live in cellars, many of whom were seen by his friend Mr. Jennings who had to use a boat to travel the streets.

He mentions 'the melancholy loss of the Cork [repel] on the [Goodcoins] it has excited much distress and sorrow here'. He instructs her to call on Mr. Swift for his half of the month's rent and cautions her to 'keep quite clear of the hospital business' as he believes the matron was at fault. He 'jokingly' instructs her to tell Brooke and Dickson that he is 'courageous' and 'bold' and that as 'audaces fortuna jurat' , he has secured good lodgings for 15 shillings per week, and is not charged over the long vacation. He mentions there is to be a public dinner for Sir Robert Kane the next week but he will miss it as he had a prior engagement with Major Ludlow Beamish, and is quite happy to miss it.

At Cloyne he noticed a cluster of 12 ruined cottages all at one time the homes of brogue makers 'an extinguished branch of Irish history’. He spent his first night in Ballycotton with Rev. G. Kingston, the rest in rooms in Ballycotton which were fine although 'cleanliness was not the household virtue of those who had the letting of the house'. His maid Sarah 'a barefooted but apparently modest and intelligent maiden' bought provisions from Mrs. Riordan who also owned the cars in that area. On Sunday he went to church: 'a very good congregation and a rather eloquent and very pleasing sermon'. He received a visit there from Captain Bervey 'one of the men who closed the door of the farmhouse on the field of Waterloo' and a Captain Butler who had served under General Evans for the Queen of Spain. He also visited the houses of weavers and spinners who were organised into a business during the famine by Mr. Kingston and some Quakers. Adds he is to teach astronomy at the college which he is delighted to do. Closes with a request for news of Lincoln.

College is going well 'Nothing can be more agreeable to me than my duties. They are exciting and I feel fully master of them and know that my labours are appreciated'.

He asks her to tell William Brooke that the trees in Cork are still in full bloom due to a late spring. He also instructs her not to write to Lilley [Matthew], whom he describes as headstrong and indolent, unless he first writes to her. On the 19th he recounts details of his trip to Monkstown which he wishes she could see. He was especially impressed with the beauty of the hills 'I begin to think that I shall find my native country flat and tame after them'. He complains that he is receiving too many invitations to go out.

            Boole in Cork to Maryann discussing his life in Cork. He contrasts the cold springs of Lincoln with the mild warm spring in Ireland; and remarks that Irish people seem more healthy than the English. He feels this is due to the purity of the air, and their consuming more vegetables. Of the people he declares 'I have nowhere met with people so kind, a few individuals excepted, as in this city'. He has made some valuable friendships including one with Dr. Ryall 'a truly good man'. Dr. Ryall has invited him to visit Killarney with him and the Everests but he refuses to go unless Maryann goes too. Mentions that he has got her some plates.

It deserves all that has been said of it'.

His return to Lincoln will be delayed as he is suffering from lumbago brought on by over-tight shoes. Mentions the exquisite marbles he saw in the British Museum and urges her to visit them; 'they and the hippopotamus which I have also seen are the great attractions in London just now'. He has finished his work at the College of Preceptors and is busy buying books. He visited Mr. and Mrs. De Morgan who urged him to publish his works soon. He had a letter from their brother Charles agreeing to Maryann and their mother coming to live with him. As for himself 'I feel more and more devoted to a life of science and my recent holiday will I hope only send me back to my old pursuits with greater ardour'. He closes by telling her to keep her spirits up: 'All I doubt not will be well and we shall see happy days again'.

            Boole in Cork to Maryann discussing college matters. Although more students enrolled this year, they did not join his classes which have shrunk. However he feels smaller classes tax a teacher less than large ones. He is to lecture 10 to 12 o'clock, three mornings a week and from 11 to 1 o'clock one day and 10 to 11 o'clock the remaining day. His own work is going well and gives him comfort. He comments on Kane's Presidential address which he and others felt dwelt too much on Catholic grievances 'to the almost total exclusion of another faith either in the college or out of it'. Socially, he visited Col. Chesney in Ballincollig with De Vericour, and has been invited to dinner with the Protestant bishop of Cork 'I shall be glad to go not because he is a bishop but because I feel sure that I shall like him'. He quotes a line of Latin which he instructs her to translate for herself, he hopes she is getting on well in her new house.

'She [Mrs. Chesney] is clever good and beautiful ... now are you satisfied?'. He discusses his lecture rota which suits him to perfection, and his dinner with the bishops of whom he says 'so much modesty and unaffected goodness are not often seen'. They discussed the writings of Dr. Peter Browne a predecessor of the bishop. The Archdeacon (who like the Dean of Cork asked for his address) offered him the use of his pew in church which Boole declined 'as I am very jealous of any invasion of my Christian liberty on the Sabbath'. He morosely remarks that he is writing gossip as no newsworthy events have occurred. His life revolves around lecturing and walking, and complains '... England must be more politically exciting'. He responds to questions asked in her letter and inquires about Lincoln opinion on 'the popish invasion'. He has stopped subscribing to The Leader, which he describes as 'a ruinous speculation'.

            Boole in Cork to Mary discussing his life there and the vacancy for a Professor of Mathematics at Manchester. He remarks on how pleasant life can be in Cork and describes a trip he took to Passage, Monkstown and Ringaskiddy with Dr. Ryall. At Ringaskiddy a hospitable local woman cooked them potatoes for their dinner and he extols the beauty of that area. A 'manoeuvre' was anchored in the harbour which he boarded. Boole was awed by the size of the ship 'The space between decks was quite like a town'. He then turns to a discussion of the Manchester position citing the advantage of staying or leaving Cork. His salary at Cork will never rise above £350 p.a. and he feels Catholic and Protestant tension in England will affect the success of the college. He discusses Manchester as a future home and adds 'I should have no doubt of succeeding in Manchester. .. I have acquired the habit of working steadily and systematically without overworking myself and this of inestimable importance'. However, for him the basic question is where would he be most useful and be best equipped to pursue his studies. '... upon which my ultimate position in this world should I live and my reputation afterwards will depend'. He also fees a sense of commitment to those who hired him. Anxiously, he inquires for her opinion.

            Boole in Cork to Maryann, he opens with a criticism of her handwriting. She sent him some Italian verse none of which he could make out due to her handwriting and adds 'In writing a foreign language it is very necessary to be careful of one's penmanship'. Professor Nicholls has told him a Professorship of Maths is soon to fall vacant at St. Andrews, but he is not going to apply as 'I do not however think that the advantages are sufficiently great to justify a breaking up of my present associations'. He also has some qualms about the 'severe church of Scotland.' He mentions Miss Palethrop's circular which he feels she would be better sending for some reasons of delicacy to the archbishop herself. He has instructed his publishers to send Maryann six copies of The Laws of Thought and tells her who he wants to receive them. Closes with an assurance he does not want her to use any of the revenue from her school for the upkeep of the house.

He speaks also of his life in Cork where he has met many 'estimable persons whose acquaintance is not readily found but who are worth a host of ordinary acquaintances'. However, he complains his evenings are full with socialising and he has little time for study. Mentions a trip he took to Leemount with Lady Kane and describes the plant life they saw.

            Boole in Cork to his mother. He is lonely and wishes her and Maryann were with him but resolves 'why wish for what cannot be'. He is, however, thankful for the friendships he has made in Cork. He describes his lodgings which are 'scrupulously clean' and his landladies who are very kind and attentive and very English in their ways. Even the air and water there are more pleasant than in his old lodgings. He has decided never again to give or accept dinner invitations but visit the teatable instead: 'this is by far the most rational ways for those who want to talk and not to eat.' On 25 March he describes an enjoyable walk he had and a less enjoyable visit to the house of a government official. The other guests were 'full of grumbling against England and our government a thing which I am not disposed to hear without making some effort to defend them.' He feels many Irish people have preposterous notions about the English government and people, 'that England delights to see Ireland miserable', but he puts a lot of the belief down to 'an exaggerated way of talking.' His social life in Cork is much more active than it was in Britain, but he resolves not to let it interfere with his studies. Mentions he is thinking of going to London soon (the fare via Bristol first class is £2.5s.0d., and hopes Maryann will write as it is over a fortnight since he heard from her.

He hopes Charles does not feel he has been neglecting him as he has had to write to so many others but he thinks often of him and William and wishes they both could be with him. He is occupied daily from 1 - 3 o'clock in lecturing and examining 'in fact teaching' and then works himself for three or four hours on an introductory treatise on logic for his class. He is not totally happy with his new home 'I cannot say that I like Cork or its climate'. He describes the city as 'dirty', but acknowledges it has some pretty suburbs and wishes Charles could join him in the area for springtime. He also noticed the singing in the churches is of an unusually high standard. Mentions during the week he intends to inspect some schools for poor children run by the Christian Brothers, and describes a channel of the Lee flowing by Castle White which reminded him of a similar stream at home. He inquires after Lincoln neighbours, from whom he would be glad to hear but hopes to see them all at Christmas when he has 18 days off. Mentions he finds the President and Vice President of Q.C.C. 'models of gentleness and kindness', the Vice President Dr. Ryall is to dine at Castle White the next week. He jokingly compares the residents of Castle White with a religious community with himself as a lay brother.

An added paragraph in the typed copy states the poem is given to preserve Brooke's name as a dear friend of Boole's, and also in a fit of depression thinking he was dying Brooke destroyed all Boole' s letters as he did not know into whose hands they would fall.

            Typescript copies of letters from Boole to William Brooke. (a) 18 June 1855 Boole in Cork to Brooke discussing college affairs. He feels Dr. Ryall would have made a better president than Kane 'Had he been placed at the head of this college if would have flourished'. He is stinging in his criticism of Kane: 'when a President systematically neglects his duties, spends here one month in the year, yet holds powers which are essential to the well government of the college .... when the most reasonable and temperate efforts to bring about a better state of things exposes a man to the charge of faction and subjects them to the frown of power I do not see what but none can be expected' . He is debating with himself whether or not to make public the affairs of the college. He implores Brooke to visit him, not to see the country but 'to come over and cheer the lonely hours of captivity'. Adds humorously that Brooke might leave singing 'The Bells of Shandon' , which he quotes. He does add that Cork 'is I firmly believe the best place in Ireland'. Mentions the local protestants are angry over the bishop inviting the Catholic Bishop to dinner when the lord lieutenant was also present. He closes with good wishes and adds 'The Indian Examinership has passed me by as I expected it would'. (b) Incomplete letter 3 Oct 1855 from Boole in Tenby, thanking Brooke for cashing a draft for 15s.0d. and promising to send him a balance of an account. His wife Mary urged him to write anything except poetry to Brooke having a theory that the poetry which is in a man ought to be for home consumption and ought not to evaporate in words. Here she says that 'professed poets are dull and prosaic people in common life. I am disposed to think that she is right'. He also describes a recent visit to Tintern and invites Brooke to Cork.

He advises him against going to Germany but rather to stay home and build up his practise. He also describes his life in Cork to him; he likes his situation and feels his work there is of use. Out of the 98 students who attend the college 61 or 62 go to his lectures. He gets on well with all his colleagues and names Dr. Fleming as the most distinguished member of the science faculty adding 'he appears to me to be a very acute and clever man.' He mentions a paper he is writing for the 'Journal' and states his two previous essays were premature - 'I am still working on the same subject and with great success.' He hopes to see him in Chester on his next visit home.

He thanks Hamilton cordially for sending him copies of his work which he enjoyed and admired, but he does find some fault with them: 'will you forgive me for adding that I do not think that upon all points you have manifested that freedom from prejudice which is essential to the formation of right judgement?' After arguing that all subjects can suffer from one-sidedness he proceeds to argue against Hamilton's view of maths: 'Now while I admit to be true that many minds have been absorbed to a very injurious extent in Mathematical pursuits, I cannot judging from the nature of the case and from individual experience believe that such is a necessary or a proper result'. He explains that in his case maths spurred on his interest in other subjects. He also brings Hamilton to task for being too severe on De Morgan. He closes in a conciliatory tone: 'I hope that it is not needful to offer any apology for the freedom of some of my observations, and merely to have thanked you for your very valuable work would not have conveyed my real feelings or convictions as to its great merit?'

His expectations were not being realised in Waddington so he relinquished his lease at unfavourable terms but which 'I am able to make without putting myself under obligations and willing to make in order to get out of the business with honour and an unstained character'. He thanks him for sending an analysis of Galls system and would like his opinion of it. His own opinions on educational matters 'is as yet by no means made up, perhaps in all points never will be'. He advises Hill to extend his studies beyond the exact sciences and warns maths can 'deaden the imagination and destroy the relish for elegant literature and indispose the mind for everything but the bare pursuit of abstract truth'. He hopes that in the future knowledge of mathematics could be obtained without any waste of exertion, and discusses at length the place of maths in education. Adds he would enjoy a more varied correspondence on some of the subjects raised in the letter.

              Copy letter from Boole in Waddington to Hill, good humouredly complaining that Hill did not visit him on a recent trip to Lincoln, but promises to forgive him if he writes a long letter on a interesting subject (he suggests Gill's system and method of Sunday School teaching). He recommends Hill to study Joachim's Life of Erasmus which he gives a brief sketch of the content and arrangement of. He also mentions he sent a number of maths papers to Cambridge where they were well received. Refers to a new Baptist Chapel which is about to be opened in Waddington followed by a social tea evening and comments 'The religious world is growing very social and very fond of tea which are two good signs'. Then with a long rambling prologue laden with historical and mythological references he states he can at last reveal part of a mystery he has known for many years. 'For 70 mornings then at the hour of six, visit the second milestone on the eastern bank of the Humber and for 3 and 4 1/2 minutes direct your face to the eastern horizon. On the 71st visit at the_ [expiration] of your watch you will perceive ... but I anticipate the mystery' but promises it is worth seeing.

              Copy letter from Boole in Lincoln to Kirk mainly discussing university. First he inquires if his note of introduction to Chessman (whom he finds a' very pleasant agreeable fellow) was of use. In a section marked confidential, he tells him he believes his father is dying and he is urging Boole to enter Cambridge, his sister and brothers second this. He has not yet decided to go or not, but if he did he would attend one of the smaller colleges and would not make mathematics his principal pursuit. He could afford to spend £80 - £100 per annum, asks Kirks opinion on the matter. He adds he feels he has a duty to society to use his talents, and is disillusioned with teaching as 'the amount of evil that grows up spontaneously among boys shut up together in a boarding school is almost greater than the good you can impart'.

He is doubtful whether or not he will see Kirk as planned as he is not now going to London; the College of Preceptors cannot afford to pay the expenses owed to him, and are treating them as advance subscriptions. He shows a marked change in attitude to Cambridge 'I detest from the bottom of my heart the cold pride of useless scholarship' but asks Kirk not to show anyone the letter as people will label him a grumbler against 'our glorious constitution in Church and State', but explains it's just that he prefers quiet and simplicity.

Mentions all in Lincoln are taking great interest in the events in France, Germany and Italy, and he presumes news of the revolts have penetrated even Cambridge 'where pale young men intent upon Greek accounts and double integrals lift up their heads and speculate upon the world whose existence they had almost forgotten'.

He also mentions Cooper's honesty and sincerity and hopes Larken has not formed an overly bad impression of him. He visited Mr. Chapman who lent him a volume of Emerson's poetry, and Mr. De. Morgan who gave him a reader's ticket for the British Museum valid for six months and declares 'It will scarcely be possible to feel dull in London after this'. He mentions De Vericour bought Larken a very fine copy of 'Lamiennons Evangiles' which is a more expensive illustrated copy than the one Larken had previously.

              Boole in Lincoln to Larken, he is sending him his mathematical book to keep for two years and gives strict instructions that Larken is not to give them back to him before that time. If he repeatedly asks for their return Larken is to 'ban them even as the books of those which used magical arts were burned' .

              From Boole in Bamsgate to Larken, informing him he will be back in Lincoln in time to attend the meeting Larken spoke of. He remarks on the political situation in Europe stating 'it is sad that it takes trouble abroad to make Christians do their duty,' but he doesn't think things are likely to change, 'I suppose that we are not to look for this before the millennium'. He describes in rapturous tones his visits to the British Museum and the cliffs of Dover. He is reading Montfarcois 'Antiquities of Italy' and Carlyle's Letters and speeches of Oliver Cromwell, which has 'a certain massive and rugged grandeur whatever one may think of its philosophy'. Closes as Maryann has returned to accompany him on a walk.

              Boole in Lincoln to Larken discussing the arrangements for the presentation of public gifts to him to celebrate his appointment at Q.C.C. He is conferring with William Brooke as to what books he will choose and says he would be delighted to receive a silver inkstand as proposed: 'To this I should have no objection and as it would gratify my mother and sister and others. I should be glad if it could be so arranged'. He also agrees to a public presentation at which he could thank everyone for their kindness. Also sends sympathy to Larken who is ill.

He hopes Larken will do well but cautions him against working too hard and prospering too much. He is fine and hoping to build a house. He adds 'If I had my present lot in England I think I should have no earthly wish ungratified'. Also thanks him for the unusually neat way in which he returned a book.

              Boole to John Larken telling him about the fire at Q.C.C.. The damage was calculated at £6,000 with £2,000 worth of equipment lost. He also discusses the building of a Cathedral in Cork, to be constructed of limestone and bathstone. He remarks in Ireland labourers work for 6d. a day less than they do in England where they receive 1s.6d or 1s.8d. per day. However they get less work done in a day than an English labourer. If Larken wishes to tender for the contract he advises him to come and view the site but warns he may have problems: 'I should think Irish workmen very difficult from an Englishman to deal with. They are very much given to striking'. He adds if he has room he would be glad to put Larken up.

He describes the countryside around Cork and the college, he mentions the steady rainfall and that he has heard Cork referred to as the rain basin of Ireland. He refers to a report on the opening of the college which is to be featured in the next edition of the Illustrated London News. He adds he would be delighted to find on his return that they all had been good boys 'steady to your labours faithful and obedient to your teachers, kind an courteous to each other, obliging to all with whom you have to do', and states he would be proud to hear from any of them.

            Boole to Taylor in Leeds, opens with a friendly reprimand to Taylor for not writing and goes on to discuss his work. He tells him he has moved to Pottergate in Lincoln, and is so busy teaching and writing maths papers he has neglected general literature. He reveals he has some ideas for discussion which would make their correspondence 'useful' but he wishes to develop them further before airing them. He was upset to hear Leed's Cathedral burnt down and hopes Taylor was not one of those who dismissed its monuments as archaic, as they were, Boole feels, symbols of medieval faith that have only recently come to look out of place.

            Letter from Boole to Taylor plus typed copy discussing studies and religious matters. He recommends lectures on physical science by Roget published in the library of Useful Knowledge, mentions he finds writing a great aid to study, and he has done away with slates in his school and is using pens instead. He then discusses various academic matters, the works of Brown, the study of mental philosophy and how it leads to a growth of genuine poetry and the reception of religious belief. On this last subject he states 'I hesitate not to avow myself in belief a Christian', although he places his 'hopes of future happiness on the great propitiatory sacrifice and atonements of the Saviour'. On other issues such as the freedom of human will (which he sees as minor point) he has ceased to think and adds 'I doubt whether I am a Christian at all except in mere speculation'. He says he has expressed his feelings more fully than ever before but he does not want Taylor to enter into correspondence on personal religion as he feels this would lead to hypocrisy on his part. Rather he hopes their correspondence will continue to stimulate them both.

            Boole in Lincoln to Taylor, he apologises for not having enough time to write a long letter but instead resolves to 'offer a few remarks on a subject alluded to in your last and briefly propose a plan of correspondence from which you may probably derive much benefit'. The discussion revolves around Brown's thoughts on will and ideas, with which Boole disagrees. He suggests Taylor should study mental and natural philosophy, and draw up at intervals an abstract of such principles and theories of a particular issue and send this to Boole with his own thoughts. Boole then might be able to add some helpful comments, but· he states the writing of the work alone would be most useful. Mentions he had advertised in the Leeds 'Mercury' for an assistant.

            Boole to Taylor, opening with profuse apologies for not writing earlier. Also he has lost Taylor's last letter so his responses to the questions might not be too comprehensive. As Taylor requested he discussed the identity of memory, conception and imagination, he sees the main difference between memory and imagination as being conception. He then switches to address a second letter from Taylor asking for his advice. He is seemingly depressed but Boole assures him all students become apathetic and despondent at some time, as all humans have periods of low energy, and he gives him study advice. Mentions he has also had a letter from Dyson whom he feels is an enterprising student.

He then fills Taylor in briefly on his situation, saying school work takes up most of his time with the rest going to preparing a manuscript for publication. He mentions Dyson has settled at [Guinsboro] and is doing well and asks for Taylor's news.

He recommends Dr. Arnold's Life and Correspondence which he read and enjoyed, and mentions again his religious affiliations 'I should not hesitate to avow myself in principle and in profession a churchman. More than this I can scarcely say'. He also is determined to avoid taking sides on religious questions which divide Christians.

He apologises for not writing earlier, but he has just had one book printed and another still in the press and finds letter-writing a continuation of work, so he avoids it. He gives some family news; Maryann, recently returned from Germany, is now living in Cork as governess to the bishop's children, and is very happy with her position. As for himself although he is happy in Cork he is 'looking forward to settling in England in some way before long', he gives a brief description of his children and concludes 'on the whole life passes pleasantly on though in a country in which I can never feel at home'. He then turns to discuss the prospects of peace between England and France saying he has heard many conflicting statements about the French. He recognises the Commercial Treaty as fact and presumes Free Trade will be the future. He mentions no volunteer rifle corps formed in Ireland as 'The Roman Catholic Priesthood seem to have been doing all they can to preach disloyalty' and declares 'This is a country which does not on the whole present the most favourable picture of Christianity'.

He also recollects that Boole was a rather solitary child 'he never played with his school-fellows but had one to two friends of congenial minds'. He adds that Boole's father was a self-educated man who taught himself accountancy and maths and who understood Euclid easily.

He gives comfort to her and himself by saying in George's death 'I see the wise hand of Providence'; also he recognises her loss is greater than others as she and George were so close. He has informed the Perrys and the Chalonders of Boole's death as he was keeping them up to date during the illness. He is relieved to hear Mary Boole is recovering - she had sent him a letter stating all was over. The letter was calm in tone although 'The agony was in it - but not as it works in common minds'. He welcomes the tributes the press are giving Boole but adds 'I wish I might hope that the Catholic Press also did him justice'. He then turns to speak of his memories of Boole - 'He was made up of an exquisite reality and simplicity' - and mentions the commotion caused by Boole when he was ill and sent his translations of Melagers 'Ode to Spring' (which he wrongly ascribes to Horace), to a local newspaper and some people refused to believe that the work was that of a young boy. He adds Hutchin had broken the news of the death to him before Mrs. Gibson's letter reached him, and he at once assisted in the compilation and correction at local authorities. One incident though is preying on his mind. Before he learned Boole was ill he had sent Mary Boole a hymn containing the lines 'And thou, beloved Mary, Long partner of my cares, In this dark path are torn away In agony of tears' and he hopes it did not unduly upset her. In a postscript he muses on how much harder it is to cope with the loss of a sibling than a parent whom one accepts will predecease one.

He is glad to hear she is coming home and thanks her for being so kind to Boole's widow and children and also for sending him a lecture of Boole's. He mentions another lecture on polytheism which he hopes will be found. She had requested him to send any memories he has of Boole's early life and family which he now does. He mentions the controversy over her father's post as curator of the Mechanics Institute but he cannot remember why he resigned apart from some dissension with a Mr. Hunt as her father's 'high spirit would not submit to be dictated to by a man whose principal feature was a blustering and unfeeling interference'. In connection with Boole's school at Waddington he remembers the rent was very high and Boole had not enough boarders and the failure of a Mr. Hall to canvass for them. Boole's despondency over the matter he says is clearly evidenced in his correspondence with Mr. Moor Hamilton, Hall's Lawyer. He adds Boole was bailed out by Mr. Newton (the butcher). Closes with expressions of goodwill.

His thoughts turn to Mary Boole and he hopes she will be alright during the coming winter as her house is very exposed, but adds the landlord might add a porch, and her new child should be a joy to her.

He exclaims 'oh the delights of the suburbs, with an aggressive population and never a constable' . Mentions his sister-in-law is home. His thoughts then turn to religion and 'How one sometimes (thoughtfully) is inclined to envy the poor Catholic their pious ejaculations of ‘God rest his soul’'. He feels it must be a great comfort to know one's prayers are helping those in purgatory, and adds in his old age he finds his thoughts turning more and more to theology. He also brings up an article he read about a 150ft. long sea serpent living in a Scotch lake. He has never heard any more about it and half believes he probably dreamt the article up and adds jokingly 'who knows but he might turn up in Killarney'.

            Brooke to Maryann. In a letter covering many subjects he mentions the religious troubles in Ireland which he feels are caused by the Roman Catholic priesthood, and mentions Clarke in Canada (See Also BP/1/255) must also be troubled by rebels. Also mentions he is under the care of Dr. Banks. He would have loved her to visit but all his spare rooms are filled with books in preparation for a sale. Mentions there was 'a remarkable display of sheet light last night' which he gleefully remarks caused great confusion in Churches and Chapels. He also makes some obscure references to Gladstone 'and Mr. Gladstone pray let him go and remonstrate'.

In an unusually morbid tone he discusses his health and his belief he has reached 'the beginning of the end', but adds he only tells her this to excuse his delay in sorting papers for Mrs. B. [Mary Boole]. He is looking through Boole's 'Cambridge letters' and can reassure her no confidential conversation between herself and Boole was mentioned in them. In Lincoln the streets are snowed up 'like nothing in Ireland as I believe'.

            Brooke to Maryann thanking her for her kind letter. He cannot remember if he replied to it, but will do so now anyway. He was delighted to hear of her visit to Cork. He has 'sweet recollections' of his own visit, and would enjoy seeing little Alice. His nephew's son is doing very well at school and his nephew wrote to say his son would be a second Boole 'didn't I make a wry face at reading it'. His delay in writing has been due to his upset over 'an humiliating and disgusting affair'. The pastor at the local Church was convicted of 'trying to corrupt the minds of some innocent little girls for the most detestable purposes'; he was sentenced to six months hard labour. He adds a postscript referring to his sister-in-law as being his only comfort beyond poignant memories of dead friends.

            Brooke to Maryann, explaining he only sent half a letter the last time to her. This present letter has a rambling tone and he opens by telling how much he is looking forward to the return of his sister-in-law. He then 64speaks of his tardiness in reading Wordsworth, a poet he has too long neglected; 'this is not matter to be glibly run over like Scott or Moore'. He complains about the lack of powerful preaching in Lincoln and marvels at how strong the lungs of medieval monks who had to preach in the open air must have been. Following from this he gives a brief history of the Asylum grounds formerly owned by the Duke of Lancaster. He ends with some comments on a brief for the Bishop, a Latin Epistle to 'The old Catholics' in Cologne calling up 'vain regrets for the lov'd and lost. My dear father and your dear brother would have looked on with great interest'. The article also calls for retribution rather than peace. Adds he encloses 'all the scraps, intended for you'.

He discusses Boole's love of knowledge and his belief that only reading of a subject can make one proficient in it. But he believed too much reading had strained his left eye, and he was convinced he would eventually go blind. So he began to practice playing music which he felt would be a comfort to him if he lost his sight, but he played only sacred music.

            Original plus typed copy of a letter from Charles Clarke in Canada to Maryann, thanking her profusely for writing, and discussing his requested recollections of Boole. He opens however with a long passage on the different types of weather experienced in Canada 'because you Englishmen who stay at home at ease underrate our Canadian climate'. He has heard English people believe Canadians never see the sun and feed on blubber to survive the cold. He then turns to his recollections of Boole. Boole's mother was the midwife who delivered him, and later he attended Boole's school in Grammar School Lane. His mother had sent him there as she wanted him to be educated as an usher (assistant teacher), but he had other plans and became an assistant draper. He makes the premise that all his recollections are therefore those of a schoolboy. He remembers Boole taking the class on walks on which he would become so lost in thought the walk would last an hour more. Of Boole's character he says 'when he did unbend he must have been a genial companion, rich in almost childlike love of fun and frolic'. In his school he rejected learning by rote, and tried to impart to the boys ideas rather than words. Every Friday he would give a special lecture on a subject picked by the boys on the preceding Friday. He taught a variety of subjects including astronomy and geology, and often spoke in awe of electricity 'the one natural agent by which the Creator performed his great work in the universe'. He had however some faults as a teacher - his handwriting was bad due to faulty sight and he was useless at cricket. Clarke mentions an incident where one day Boole set his pupils a problem which had been puzzling the scholars of Lincoln but which he had solved as a boy. This situation reminded Clarke 'of the boy Christ confounding the doctors'. To encourage his pupils Boole would tell them how he loved to spend his Saturday half-holiday translating Virgil and says Helen [of Troy] was his first love. He was fond of both music and poetry, especially Milton. He was also strong and agile and used exhort his pupils to emulate Greek athletes. He hated cruelty and fighting in the school was a punishable offence. If a boy broke the school rules a mock trial was held to ascertain the punishment, and also to teach the boys how to conduct public meetings. He felt Boole was very religious and inclined towards Unitarianism, and he also believed nature was a Church built by God. The severest beating Clarke can remember him giving was to a boy called Rogers who was repeatedly caught stealing birds eggs, Boole flew into a rage with the boy, smashed the eggs and thrashed him. Despite this Clarke believes not a single ex-pupil disliked him. As an incentive to work Boole operated a ticket system by which tickets would be given for good work and could then be saved to buy privileges; 20 tickets equalled a half holiday. Clarke feels this method was a greater incentive to work than all the gilt-edged books given out on prize-giving day. Boole preferred to teach using visual aids and once took his pupils to a hill to view an approaching thunderstorm to explain the difference in speed of light and sound. He recalls that in Waddington Boole had fallen into debt, but that he was comfortably off in Lincoln. Mentions he never saw a notice for The laws of Thought appear in a Canadian newspaper. He again reiterates that all his memories are boyish ones but hopes they can be of help. Adds Boole had a strong interest in astronomy, telescopes and cameras. Closes by telling her it only takes 13 days for a letter from Lincoln to reach Canada.

            To Maryann from M. Davis, 3 Albert Terrace, Antaly Road [Lincoln], sympathising on her bereavement and recounting her memories of Boole in a glowing tribute. Unfortunately she destroyed when ill all letters from friends which she did not want others to read, and so has none from Boole. She declares she was glad Boole never attended a university as it would have left him very 'strait'. She feels also that Boole might have had a premonition of early death as he said on their last meeting that that could be the last time that she would see him on this earth. She recollects he went to Waddington about 1832. She didn't see him then until 1847 and last saw him on 8 September 1860. Boole never made her feel intellectually inferior but gave her inner confidence. He was beloved in Waddington and regarded as a great teacher. She was shy of seeking his company 66as she was in awe of his 'mental greatness' so she did not know him very well but remarks Boole and Mr. Hall [her uncle] held each other in high mutual esteem. Boole could also be very absent-minded, and would sprinkle his food with an empty salt spoon, and then eat not noticing the food was unseasoned. Mr. Hall had always regretted the fact that Boole never went to college. She adds she never heard or saw an act of violence or severity performed by Boole against his pupils (see BP/1/225 above).

On Tuesday 22 November he had a cough and felt very tired, but was lucid and discussed shareholder moves in the local gas company. The cold lasted a week so on the Sunday a doctor was called. Then Mrs. Gibson moved in at Mrs. Everest's request to look after Mary and ensure the children did not bother Boole. She tells Maryann he felt little pain, but was very peaceful with a clear mind. She mentions one of his last acts was to send money to the Dispensary doctor for the poor, and offers her sympathy to Maryann for her loss.

            To Maryann from Joseph Hill, 7 Parliament Street, Hull. He is writing in response to Maryann's request to send her any letters or reminiscences of Boole. He mentions Waddington School which he has a faint memory of Boole sustaining a loss on when he surrendered the lease although he does not know why Boole had to leave, and he would prefer not to speculate. He does not feel though that he has much information useful for a biography but promises to write what he can, to aid her biographical work he divides Boole's life into 2 periods (early life, classical period). In relation to Boole's academic life he recollects a time when Boole felt he was indulging too much in his favourite studies and resolved to explore other areas of study which would benefit him. One such area was Ethics of which Hill says 'How far he would found his system of ethics on the law of nature and how far the divine laws contained in the Bible, I do not know'. Adds Boole disapproved of [Paley]. Hill believes Boole loved maths because he could expand what others taught 'and become one of the mathematical instructors of the world', and that was the reason he choose maths over ethics. He also reveals that Boole first began to form a system for writing mathematical symbols for ideas not of a mathematical nature while he was travelling on a steamboat. He can't however remember the date. He ends by promising to write all his letters on similar paper with hinges so that they could be fastened together.

            Joseph Hill in Hull to Maryann continuing his reminiscences which he calls 'Memorabilia Booliana'. In this letter he discusses 'the fluctuations of his (Boole's) classical taste'. Boole was from an early age fond of the classics, and Hill remembers an open day at school when Boole recited his translation of Meleager's 'Ode to Spring'. While an assistant at Doncaster he continued his classical studies but later his taste changed to more modern literature. He spoke French, Italian and German and as his interest in these grew his interest in the Classics faded (Hill gives some examples of this change). At one point he had wished to learn Hebrew but he didn't want to overtask his weak eyesight with Hebrew characters.

            Joseph Hill to Maryann continuing his remembrances of Boole. In this letter he concentrates on Boole's love of maths and his health. As schoolboys they used to amuse themselves with algebra and later Boole enjoyed solving the maths problems posed in the 'Ladies Diary' (see BP/1/222(3). In 1861 they went together to the International Exhibition in London where they viewed Babbage's calculating machine. Boole stated he did not understand the machine so Hill found a gentleman explaining its works to a lady and asked him to explain it to Boole also. While they were talking Mr. Babbage arrived and entered into a long conversation with Boole: 'the two great men together seemed to have taken steps towards the construction of that great prodigy a thinking machine'. He also remembers Boole once folding some paper to an angle of 450 and using it to measure distance and height. He also recalls that Boole liked to express mathematical ideas in a visible form. In relation to Boole's health he remembers him once walking from Lincoln to Doncaster, although he would never do so again. He was a sturdy walker of hills, but his sight was poor and he often had trouble deciphering Greek characters because of it. Hill himself believed diet altered a persons character and recalls that Boole ate a great deal of salt, even on bread and butter.

            Letter from Hill to Maryann plus partial typed copy, continuing his reminisces with the provisio 'I can only supply raw material to be cooked by his biographer'. He apologizes also for the irregular order of his recollections. He speaks here of Boole's attitude to people and to God. He could form a lasting attachment to people one such being Matthew Lilly who died a year before Boole did, and Hill's aunt whom Boole referred to 'as a very interesting old lady' and whom he introduced to Elihu Berritt. Boole despised those who after climbing the social ladder ignored their old friends. Also if he was criticising a friend he never mentioned their name so as not to damage their characters. He refers to a philosophical discussion he had with Boole over whether nature follows laws, or if it is used by God as he wishes. He recalls Boole stating everything that happens is affected by the power of God and that life would cease to exist if God's power was removed.

He also offers her the services of his clerks to copy material for the biography. He remembers once suggesting to Boole that instruments should be made to imitate the sound of nature. Boole remonstrated with him and declared music is not an imitative act. He generally treated Hill's contempt of music as a matter for humour.

            Hill to Maryann again expressing his grief over Boole's death and enclosing the poems by Mrs. Moulton and Mrs. Carlyon (see BP/1/262, above) (not in collection). He has been having difficulty compiling biographical material as he wishes to avoid repetition. Also he lost a book into which he had copied Boole's letters but he also blames his delay on his own 'procrastinating habits'. He parallels Boole's life and all men's with that of a river 'in some of which there are many turns and in some comparatively few' and mentions a tum in Boole's life when he moved from classical study to concentrate on modem languages, and appeared to develop a disrelish towards the former. He suggests that in her biography (see BP/l/306) she should try and separate the different periods of Boole's life 'the classical period, the ethical period, the literary period'. Mathematics however were always a part of his life to the extent that 'he was engaged in laying the formulation of a new science having some relation to mathematical logic and mental philosophy but not identical with any of them'.

She refers to a very pleasant visit to Sleaford she took with Maryann's sister-in-law and Miss Cronin. She is growing increasingly deaf, having difficulty especially hearing weak female voices and resolves to try her mother's ear trumpet. She mentions Richard [Andrew], a friend of Boole's who was 'like many other tradesmens' sons at college was sadly damaged by association with jovial fellows above him in rank'. She promises to seek out people's recollections of Boole but she will be hampered by the fact she rarely leaves her house. She herself remembers his wide range of knowledge and modesty and adds she hopes Mary Ellen is bearing up well; 'Feebler minds would fall into a torpid grief. Mentions Bernard who sent three or four letters to her which she forwarded to EB as they had 'some Cambridge features which Bernard has racily sketched especially of Prof. Lea'.

She remarks she found the Wicklow coastline very shingly and invaluable. She is reading Lord Dutteren's work and remarks on the pleasure her imagination gets from the phrase 'the girls have got hold of the four ropes'. She also refers to her concern for Boole living in Blackrock as that area is very stormy during winter. She mentions reports of panic in Wolverhampton and 'disgusting riots' at Nottingham where bread and meal were plundered and thrown about and windows were smashed, and also the 'disgusting expenditure' of the recent mayoral elections, and the popularity of Clayton as mayor. Thanks Boole for news of 'Pussy' (Mary Ellen Boole) and closes by telling her Bernard is dead.

            To Maryann from [ ] in Gainsborough recording his memories of Boole his old teacher. Boole first came to Doncaster in 1831 where 'his advice and example gave the first impulse to Prose literacy pursuits that have been my chief solace and happiness through life' and adds Boole was devoted to his pupils. He regarded Milton's 'Paradise Lost' as an example of fine poetry. For recreation he studied French so he could read Lacroix's Differential and Integral Calculus. He remembers Boole sitting at his desk mechanically intoning 'Hush Hush' to the pupils when there was no noise. This the class found very amusing. He relates a number of anecdotes about Boole's childhood. As a young boy his father would give him some Euclid to study and reward him with a cake or toast if he did it well. He also remembers him rescuing a boy named Clegg who was out of his depth one day in a river in Lincoln. He also quotes some verses Boole wrote for him to send as a response to a Valentine. He also mentions the controversy caused by the publication of his translation of 'Ode to Spring'. He recollects Boole was very fond of music especially plaintive airs, and that he played the flute and the violin. He remembers Boole as having high regard for his parents.

            To Maryann in Lincoln from [ ] giving the writer's requested recollections of Boole, but adding 'I feel myself quite inadequate for the task to do justice where it is so deservedly due'. He begins by speaking of Boole's excellence as a young scholar; they met first in Lincoln aged 15 or 16 and often took long walks together in the countryside where he says 'I often forgot I was weary so valuable was all the thought and all he said'. He mentions Boole's love of study, and his interest in poetry especially Lord Byron and quotes passages from Boole's favourite poems including some by John Milton and Mrs. Herner. He remembers Boole used to write poetry, but he has lost any copies he had. He (Boole) had only a few close friends with similar tastes as he 'could not endure trifling company'. Towards his friends 'his affections were strong, his professions sincere, he was free from guile', and didn't like to flaunt his intelligence. He was also devoted to his family 'He honoured his father and mother, loved with enduring affection his brothers and sister'. He helped the writer get out of some dilemmas 'which are in recollection too painful to relate' by a loan. They only met twice in later years, both times by . accident in the National Gallery in London where Boole was looking at the same picture each time. On their last meeting Boole mentioned he had problems caused by the Roman Catholic priesthood, but he does not remember the particulars. The last time they met was in Lincoln where once again the writer was in poor circumstances and felt like a stranger after living in London for 20 years. Closes by hoping his recollections will be of use.

            From Maryann in Linburgh in Germany writing to Miss Davis in the form of a journal recording her stay in Germany. She requests that her 'Travellers Journal' may be passed on to her family and kept for her as a memento. Part I 6 Nov [ ], she left for Germany in the Heles McGregor. The passage was rough and she reports every lady on board was ill until they reached the Elbe 'a broad noble river'. She was then met by a friend of a friend, Mr Ehlers De Hembing, whose English sister-in-law was the sister of Sir Thomas Tobin of Ballincollig, Cork. She comments 'my first impressions of the German character are most favourable. Their hospitality appears to equal that of the Irish'. She then travelled to Henburg where she was met by a Mr. Weusthoff, and from there to Hamburg where Dr. Blennenthal's (her employer) son met her. She was a little dismayed by the Blennenthals house, as it was full of tobacco smoke and she found the sittingroom comfortless 'but I reflected that I had not come here to look for comfort and a day's familiarity with the place has made it look better'. Dr. Blennenthal himself is an invalid, crippled with a spinal or paralytic affliction, and she is to look after his five children. She finds Lineburg 'an exceedingly curious town', full of narrow streets with houses leaning towards each other. She also finds German cooking very different to what she is used to, 'I doubt whether I shall ever like very tough meat nor [ ] and herrings and mixtures of apples and potatoes'. Part II Nov - 27 Dec [ ], in which she details some of the historical and political background of Lineberg. Dr. Blennenthal is himself a senator although too ill to take any active part in government. Salt manufacture is an important industry in Lineberg, with enough manufactured there to supply all Germany. Lime trees border all public roads. She is getting to know the suburbs well as she goes daily for a long walk. It is bitterly cold, but she, prefers this to the moistness of Cork. 'Shooting and smoking' she says are the chief pastimes taught to both boys and girls from a very young age, and she adds 'Master Fritz Blennenthal although only eight years old is already an adept smoker. Music is played outdoors everyday by the military band, but ladies are not meant to stop and listen to it'. She was at a musical evening of Mendelhossen and Weber, one of eight similar concerts to be staged over the winter and costing 4s.6d.; her employers the Blennenthals are not musical. Her tastes have adapted themselves to German Cookery, and so far she has found no meat so tough as the first joint she tasted. She mentions soups are made from all sorts of material, some better than others. The vegetables come 'dressed in very strange fashions', with a favourite being a mixture of apples and potatoes, which she doesn't like at all. Pimpernichil rye bread which is made only at Osnabugh is considered a great delicacy but she finds it close, heavy and sour. She describes a normal day in the house: the family breakfast at 7.30, and then the boys go to school at 8.00, they dine at one, have coffee at 4.00 and then dine at 8.00 again. Coffee parties are very common, with Sunday being the favourite day for going visiting. Once a week they have an English evening when lady friends of the Blennenthals come to tea, after which Dr. Blennenthal begins reading from some English book which the ladies then continue. Maryann by request corrects their mispronunciations and reads last and longest. She feels Germans seem to associate gatherings with the attainment of a pursuit. Once a week they gather to read poetry also. She went also to a practise session of the local young people's choir and exclaims 'It was almost worthwhile to come to Germany for the music alone'. On Sundays there are three services during which the shops close, but reopen for the rest of the day, and ladies spend the day visiting each other. She remarks the churches are made of stone and are very large and very cold. However the service is much simpler and shorter than in England. Christmas is a very important festival in Germany, with secret preparations being made leading up to Christmas Eve when the Christmas trees are lit, the decorations which mothers prepare in secret. On Christmas Day presents are exchanged. In the Blennenthal's house after church on Christmas Eve at 7.30 p.m. the folding doors of the drawing room were thrown open to reveal a huge Christmas tree. She found the sight so impressive and beautiful she wonders why it is not more widely adopted in England. So far she has found Germans to be very kind and friendly, and much less 'slaves of fashion' and conventions of society than the English. At first she felt lost amongst such different people and customs, but now she sometimes feels so at home she forgets she is in a foreign country. She mentions her happiness that the rights of women are so well upheld in Germany, as a wife gains her husband's title e.g. Frau Doctor. She is making good progress with her German, and is getting three lessons a week from a German lady at a cost of 16 lessons for 12 shillings. English is cultivated in Germany and takes the place French does in England. However she still finds it hard work to sustain a conversation in German. To meet people, she says, you must first calion them before they will calion you. She mentions each German state has its own coinage, and she finds this very confusing. In Hanover the currency has been changed to that of Prussia, but the old currency is still in circulation as well so things are very confusing. Part III She describes the New Year celebrations which are second only to Christmas. At the parties children throw pieces of [bread] into cold water, the shape it takes will then reveal their future. She remarks Germans dance remarkably well and very fast. It is considered improper for a lady over 25 to dance, and for any woman over 30 to dance is scandalous. She remarks she doesn't enjoy the German balls. She also finds the all female parties rather slow. Schools in Lineberg are considered very good, and some English and Scots families settle there for a few years while their children are being educated. She mentions the peasantry of the area speak low German, and remarks they seem quite well off, but can never rise to another rank. The peasant women wear a peculiar lace cap and lots of jewellery. At the age of 21 all men must enter their names for conscription, and are then chosen by a lottery to join the army. Their pay is very low, three shillings per week and two loaves, so many soldiers work as servants while off duty. No officer is allowed to marry without having 16,000 thalers. She remarks German young ladies seem to have the same weakness for officers as their English counterparts. She also is quite puzzled by the fact German girls take no exercise but yet can dance for seven hours consecutively and describes the betrothal and wedding ceremonies of one young lady. She feels German ladies are not as grave and refined as the English ones and are given to swearing. Part IV She states Easter is even more highly thought of than Christmas, and it is seen as the beginning of the new school year and also as the correct time to change classes. The promotion of children to higher classes takes place in a large public ceremony, and confirmation, which is taken more seriously in Germany than England, is also performed at Easter. Mentions drunkness amongst the lower classes is much less common there than England. One of Dr. Blennenthal's sons had scarlet fever and part of his treatment consisted of rubbing his body three times daily with bacon-fat. Part V 2 June [ ] She remarks on how industriously all German ladies knit. One woman she knows has over 70 pairs of stockings all which she made herself. The girls leave home for one year after their confirmation to go to another family to learn housekeeping and to be weaned away from home. She remarks housekeeping is the main business of a woman's life. The journal then finishes in the form of a letter to George Boole, with an added unfinished journal of a trip to the [Hanz] mountains she took with some friends detailing the stops the train took, and the scenery she viewed on the way.

He appreciates the gesture but feels there is no need for it 'You will agree with me that upon an occasion such as this, the sentiment and the regard for which the act emanates are everything and the act itself nothing'. He would prefer the money to go to establishing a fund for buying an astronomical telescope. If they insist on a token, he feels a small uninscribed inkstand would be appropriate.

          A biography of Boole's life including the rough drafts compiled by Maryann Boole. It tends to be somewhat over romanticised. She concentrates on examining Boole's qualities - his generous personality; studious nature 'He told me that from boyhood he had had the conviction that logic could be reduced to a mathematical science, and that he had often made himself ill on the attempt to prove it, but that it was not until 1849 that the true method flashed upon him' (P56); magnificent intellect; love of England 'On removing to Ireland he was at once painfully struck by the absence of field walks, a want which he never ceased to deplore, and which of itself suffered to make him feel himself not at home in the country of his adoption' (P74); kindness of heart; nobility of spirit and his popularity ' ... and with ladies almost universally he was a favourite. The awe with which he first commonly inspired them at first invariably wore away as they discovered how gentle and unpretending and utterly free from pedantry he was ... how entirely in their presence the philosopher was lost in the friend' (P74). There is little or no mention of his marriage to Mary Everest or of his family life in Cork. She does not delve too deeply into his academic work, but concentrates on his development as a person rather than as a mathematician. She gives a good deal of background information about his parents. Includes extracts from some of Boole's poetry and letters he wrote to friends, also some annotations by MEH [Mary Ellen Hinton - Boole's eldest daughter].

          Typescript copy of a letter from Boole in Lincoln to his daughter Mary Ellen, telling her of his visit there. He is staying with Joseph Hill whom she met in Cork, and tells her Hill often invites children to his house. They met in school and Boole states they still learn from one another. He describes Lincoln for her and its history, adding Mr. Brooke who used and still does teach him is very interested in history; 'some people care more about old things than new ones and Mr. William Brooke is one of such people'. But adds he cares for new things when 'they are good and worth caring about'. He also looks at the world to see if it is going the way God want it to. Boole remarks 'I think the best way for us to mend the world is to try to do our own duty in it as well as we can'. He inquires if she and her sisters are being good girls and he hopes they are minding their mother. He himself is feeling very well 'I suppose because I am breathing my native air'.

            From Dr. Bury to Mary, giving his recollections of Boole's early life. They first met in Lincoln in 1844 and Bury was immediately impressed 'by the greatness of his intellect .... for the first time I had found indications of Genius'. He also possessed 'noble moral characteristics' and Bury feels he would have been too modest to wish for a biography. He seemed 'to know everything and be able to do anything'. He also played various musical instruments and could converse about medicine, anatomy, physiology, Greek, Latin, maths, French and Italian literature. At the age of 12 he understood the first six and 11th and 12th books of Euclid. Bury mentions Boole always felt very grateful to Mr. Gregory for introducing him to the scientific world when he was editor of the Cambridge Maths Journal. He adds Boole found the lives of scientists more interesting than that of kings and emperors. He had spoken of going to Cambridge but preferred studying at home with his father and mother. He could spend three days and nights with no sleep while working on his maths and snatch a few minutes of sleep during a walk or a party. He worked best at night, often writing under the bedclothes only to be unable to decipher his writing in the morning. However he constructed a wooden frame to keep his writing straight in the dark.

            From Mary Ellen Hinton to her sister Lucy Everest Boole, a letterbook, detailing her stay in Japan with her family. She writes in the form of the journal describing the places she has been, and all the new and strange sights she has seen. She begins 7 Sept 1888, describing her visit to Haneoke Bay. Mentions she enjoys reading 'Scientific Views' for its natural history articles, while her husband (Charles Howard Hinton) likes it for its articles on electricity. She refers also to her surprise in finding fly larvae and pupae in a salt water pool in Joshima. She then describes a visit to Kaneola Bay where they stayed in a Temple and made friends with the priests 'such gentle refined simple people' and described the ceremonies which took place there to protect fishermen from the perils of the sea. Mentions there were earthquakes in Yokohama. The next section [8 Jan 1889] describes her visit to Kojinoko/Homatsuya (little hill) to the hot springs there and declares 'It was very dangerous to be near there. Perhaps that was some of the fascination'. The house they hired was made of paper and was quite cold, but it had a bathhouse for hot baths. However the sulphurous odour from the water was very unpleasant. She inquires does Lucy know the reason why when the ground and road were covered with ice, there was no frost on the grass or bamboo. She remarks she also found the total absence of wind very strange. She also mentions a plant she saw whose leaves resemble a butterfly and she wonders why a plant should imitate an insect. They travelled then to lkao, a beautiful spot on a mountainside with many hot springs in the area. Unfortunately, the weather was cold and it rained all day, and stinging insects which bury themselves in peoples flesh thrive in the area. Mentions she is having an iron bath three times a day. They let their house in Yokohama to the Portuguese who are proving to be unsatisfactory tenants. 1 Sept [1889] They have now been at Ikao for seven weeks and plan to stay for four more days. It rained almost continually during the stay, sometimes for days on end without a break. In the house they are staying in, the bath is in the garden, and you sit in the hot water with the rain falling on your face. Wet skin is however never exposed to air, so colds are avoided. Where hot springs are found like in Yokohama, swimming pools are used to accommodate large numbers of people. The locals in Ikao dye all their cloth yellow from the iron springs, and all wear yellow clothing. Beads are also sometimes made from the iron deposits but it is a slow process. She mentions the looks of admiration she got from the local women for an old battered hat simply because it was yellow. 11 Dec [1889] She relates a discussion she had with Droku Enoye on the origin of the Japanese people. She argued that the Emperor Tenimco colonised Japan from China and Korea, while Enoye believed he came from heaven as did Jesus Christ 'Ikoku said this with a gentle smile which meant "Our absurdities are not more absurd than those of Fevergine's" and he objected to his race being spoken of as a curiosity'. 18 July 1890, describing a visit to a Nikko Temple, where a bell is rung to summon God each time an offering is made. She feels that is a good idea as 'I remember as a child being troubled by doubts as to whether Providence was paying attention'. The colours of the temples deeply impressed her. She remarks Buddhism is a growing religion with plenty of room for more people and she asks Lucy 'Don't you find your dislike of xtianity grows stronger every year of your life? Selection of only a few for salvation and at even that few unfairly'. In Buddhism she remarks you can always be saved. 18 Aug 1890, she is now in Nikko and advises Lucy to read up on its history which is very interesting. Historical relics are consciously preserved in the area. She mentions visiting the Torii an emblem of the Shinto religion, built for the temple pigeons to rest on. She remarks on the beautifully covered gateways and wonders 'Will any place in the world seem worth seeing after Japan? In fact I am perfectly infatuated by the country'. Her son George however prefers living works of nature to the most magnificent creations of man and preferred playing with the temple pony rather than admiring the architecture. [ ] Describing a barge trip they were forced to take from Nikko as heavy rains had flooded the roads. The trip took 12 hours but was not too uncomfortable. They stayed overnight in the bishop's house before returning to Yokohama where the weather was very hot and they found their house covered in a type of blue mould. They then returned to Nikko where they plan to stay until the end of September. In response to Lucy's enquiries about Japanese customs, she says she can't say much as Yokohama isn't like the rest of Japan, as it is very westernised. She gets her pupils to write essays on their nature customs and that is how she finds out what little she knows. One pupil explained that women wrap a blue cloth around their face when they go outdoors because "women are not nice in face". Remarks she finds Tokoyo very beautiful and solemn. [ ] Mentions their garden is now being used as a workshop for the building of a new classroom. They visited Professor Fenolosus (Professor of Philosophy in Tokoyo Naval College), as part of a 'duty call' to parents. He told them a story about a Japanese family of fire-fighters. The young men of the family would undergo vigorous training for months, and when ready, a large fire would be kindled around them which they would stand in the middle of and handle the live coals. However the family has been performing the ritual for so long that they have forgotten its purpose. [ ] She remarks that Sir Edwin Arnold in his letters to 'The Telegraph' does not exaggerate the beauty of Japan, but he does not mention enough its· other side where disease and illness can be seen 'walking openly in the streets. It is most pain full to a new-comer'. She also describes a teashop decorated with plum blossom and cabbage 'being a European vegetable it was deemed worthy of use for artistic purposes'. She attended a Lenten exhibition by the Photographic Society where Professor Milne showed slides of the effects of earthquakes and gave advice on choosing a sturdy building. Her husband intends to get a sensitometer to warn them about approaching earthquakes and she states to feel the ground shake is a frightening thing. There are also some separate sheets containing Mary Ellen's letters to Lucy. [ ] She is glad to hear their mother's health has improved, and she explains the origins of the gifts she sent and to whom each one was for. They are moving to a half Japanese, half European house, she would have preferred a totally Japanese one but none was vacant. They are thinking of hiring a cow, as milk is often hard to get and is very expensive. Mentions a Japanese woman remarked that her son Sebastian's red hair was ugly. She remarks she finds Japanese homes very attractive 'The maximum amount of beauty and comfort with the minimum amount of trouble' and extols about their spaciousness and cleanliness. 6 Nov 1891 She details the effects of the last earthquake to hit Japan. Its effects were mild in Kanazana, where she lives, while other towns were almost destroyed. The earthquake itself was a terrifying experience, worse than any other type of natural calamity 'In the Wakayana floods thousands of people perished but nobody seemed to mind particularly whereas Bandaisan will remain a word of terror'. Aftershocks are still being felt. She then speaks of the Madra, a tapestry on brown silk depicting a series of scenes of the Buddhist paradise embroidered from hair donated by 84,000 women; it is being taken on a tour allover Japan. She feels the Japanese people have been touched by the values of Buddhism. 'Here you may give a stranger a $10 note when you owe him 50 cents and feel quite sure that he will bring back the change', but she feels that religion 'has not the power to take hold of a nation and hold it. Let it then give place to some religion which can'. She feels England has not yet found its religion. The recent earthquake made her think more about religion and she states 'Only think till you have no more religious feeling left - and you arrive at no result. It is aimless groping. If these were to be the last words I should ever write I wouldn't add to them.' She then moves on to describe her children for Lucy and their different personalities and behaviour. She inquires after her own family adding 'You are such a soothing little person when I write to you I go straight ahead my pen runs along fast and ideas flow'.

She is quite amazed at the fact the long stems never seem to tangle as they grow. She says as she writes she is looking at his photograph, and inquires if Nelly read him the bible on Sunday and if he has learned to swim.

          Discussing recent family news and also their researches about her father. Her health is bad, her arteries are hardening and she is weakening, and adds [her daughter] Anne will not be able to combine looking after her and having a job. She discusses her father's poetry which she feels is overall not worth publishing, but she finds their spirit delightful. 'His Irish poems show a deep feeling for Irish troubles and a tragic incapacity to understand them'. His finest poem she feels is 'Sonnet on the number 3' (see BP/1/295) which she equates with Goethe's Hymn of the Three Archangels. Relates anecdotes she heard from her mother 'the missus' about his strength of character and states although she never knew him she is proud to be his daughter.

          Photocopy of a letter in which she discusses many of her father's papers. She thanks him for sending her a copy of ‘Sonnet to The Number 3’, and mentions John Walsh as a 'crank' who went to see her father about 'squaring the circle' (term used in alchemy). She also agrees to give the papers to The Royal Irish Academy. She mentions the Parry family of Lincoln, a daughter of which Boole is reputed to have fallen in love with in his youth, and never got over until he met Mary Everest. She refused to marry him as he would not sign the 39 Articles of the Church of England. She also states a bitter rivalry existed between her mother and her aunt Maryann Boole, as Maryann believed Mary Boole hastened her husband's death by following the recommendations of a doctor who advocated cold water cures, and making Boole lie shivering between the sheets. Ethel remarks 'The Everests do seem to have been a family of crooks and cranks'. She ends with some more up-to-date family news, she is working on a cantata 'Jerusalem' but feels at the rate she is going, she will be over by the time the entire cantata is published.
