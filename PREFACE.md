Anniversary
-----------

In 2012 I had the good fortune of being charged with bringing into the digital age the papers of George Boole, one of the only mathematicians with an Irish connection of global stature. I have been funded in this work by a stipend jointly offered by the library of University College Cork and ??? That I should be offered this challenge at a time 150 years since the passing of Boole and coinciding with the bi-centennial anniversary of the professor’s birth. If it were not for this marking of time it is unlikely that this project would have seen the light of day so soon. Ritual has its uses after all.

Code + Philosophy = ?

Well now, what the hey.

Book, meet Face

Metaphor, book + desk.

That was then, this was now: initial scholarly aims transform into the robot epistles.

This work would not have been possible without the valuable input of many people and institutions.
