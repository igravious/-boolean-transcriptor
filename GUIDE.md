## The guide to the <span class="hot-cinnamon">Open Reading Room</span> by Anthony Durity

- - -

+	overview
	--------

	What follows is a guide to getting the most out of the Open Reading Room website. I should direct your attention to the [Foreword](foreword) if you want to understand the overall purpose and function of this site. There you will also find the rationale underpinning certain features of the site; how decisions were arrived at. What you find here concerns itself with the details of using the website.

+	structure
	---------

	The structure of this guide mirrors the logical units of the website. Every page of the site has the same basic structure. Every page contains [running marginals](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/24060/what-word-defines-a-category-suited-for-both-header-and-footer) -- that is to say both a header and footer section -- and a body section. The header contains a menu bar, a breadcrumb trail, a panel allowing members to access their own data, and a strip of _download links: what will i call this?_ giving access to technical data and syndication. The footer contains institutional branding, a signature, and the [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) showing various site or project related links. The header and footer are unchanging unlike the body section. 

+	menu bar
	--------

	The main menu items of the menu bar are: [Home](welcome) (because only one project is housed here this is represented by one of the Boolean laws, x^2 = x), [Desk](desk), [FAQs & Guide](faqs_n_quide) (where this guide is located), a dropdown menu labeled *Propaganda*, a search box and button, and finally another dropdown menu this time labeled *About*.

+	menu bar details
	----------------

	The [Home](welcome) menu item brings you to the welcome page. The [Desk](desk). The [guide](FAQs & Guide) menu item leads to a list of frequently asked questions and additionally to this guide. The *Propaganda* menu contains a variety of communication-oriented entries: [http://leto.electropoiesis.org/propaganda/mouthpiece/](The Blog) where significant announcements are posted, significant mentions [reports](In the Press), [promo](Advertising and Promotional Links) should be self-evident, [merch](Merchandising) links, a self-help guide to [obey](reality distortion filters), and lastly a [http://leto.electropoiesis.org/propaganda/discourse/](The Forum) where members can while away the hours bantering and swap tales of success and woe. The search box allows search terms to be entered. These terms are matched against the description of each item and the transcription of each scan -- these are displayed accordingly with the search term highlighted. The *About* menu contains a number of entries on UCC, the archive, how the archive got here, and lastly Boole-related linmks.

+	breadcrumb trail
	----------------

	The breadcrumb trail records your path into the site, tethering you in place and providing signposting at a glance. 

+	download links
	--------------

	The download links are human-oriented and machine-oriented technical data sheets. For instance the descriptive list of the archive is available as a [PDF](archival_finding_aid?type=pdf) or [EAD](archival_finding_aid?type=ead). Both are human-readable but the EAD is also machine-readable. [About Portable Document Format](link_to_info_on_PDF) should be familiar to most, [About Electronic Archive Description](link_to_info_on_EAD) probably not. The PDF link serves up nice printed material, the EAD link serves up a file that allows you to write programs to interact with the data. A snapshot of the archive is available as an EAD file. EAD is an agreed upon XML standard in archival science. A link to an RSS endpoint is provided to allow syndication. In this context you may be wondering about aggregation. This is a topic we shall return to in time. [YAML](archival_finding_aid?type=yaml) or [EDM](archival_finding_aid?type=edm). More about these!

+	member's panel
	--------------

   The member's panel is an area that allows the user (I dislike that term but do not know why) or patron to [Sign up](members/sign_up) or you have already signed up then you can [Sign in](members/sign_in). Once you are signed in the panel displays a variety of member-related operations. You may [Edit](members/edit) your profile, [Manage](members/locked_scans) your scans or [Sign back out](members/sign_out).

+	body section
	------------

	body oh body

### welcome

When arriving at the site for the first time it can be seen that the *landing* or *home* or *front* page is actually the [welcome](Home) page. Once more projects come on stream this will welcome you to the site in general and provide a list of the projects nestled under UCC's Open Reading Room umbrella. As there is only one project at the moment the welcome page to the George Boole Collection is shown. The only link here is to [Browse](browse) the collection which brings you to a page which displays panels which bring you to complete and partial arrangements of the collection. (More on what this means in due course.)

+	the rest (for now)

The [leader](Leaderboard) menu item brings you to a page where -- if you are signed in -- your progress is compared to other members of the website or -- if you are not -- progress in general is rated and ranked.
